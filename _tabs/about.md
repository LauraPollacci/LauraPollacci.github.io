I am a researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/) and a member of the [Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory (KDD Lab)](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) at CNR Pisa.  

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Digital Humanities from the University of Pisa, with theses developed in the field of [Computational Linguistics at the CoLingLab (Computational Linguistics Laboratory)](https://colinglab.fileli.unipi.it/). 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Pisa under the supervision of Prof. Dino Pedreschi, Prof. Monica Barni, and Prof. Alina SÃ®rbu, with a dissertation exploring the combined use of Big Data and Sentiment Analysis to study human migration.  

I have collaborated on several Horizon 2020 European projects, including [SoBigData](http://www.sobigdata.eu/), [HumMingBird](https://hummingbird-h2020.eu/), [SoBigData++](http://www.sobigdata.eu/), and [MeMind](https://memind.eu/). I am currently involved in the [SoBigData.it](www.https://sobigdata.it/) Horizon 2020 project.  

My primary research interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Analytics, and Human Migration Studies, with a particular focus on the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.
